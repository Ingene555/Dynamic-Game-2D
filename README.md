# Name: Dynamic Game 2D
# Project: 2D Game with Tkinter

## Hello!

This project was created back in 2023 as an experiment to see whether it's possible to build a simple 2D game using Python’s **Tkinter** library.

### Project Goal

The main goal was to explore the capabilities of Tkinter for game development.  
Although it wasn’t easy, I realized that it’s definitely doable!

### About

- This project is **not intended for commercial use**.
- It was made purely to **improve my personal programming skills**.
- Feel free to use it for practice, inspiration, or even comparison with your own work.

### Notes

- I uploaded this project after making a few small adjustments to make the code a bit more understandable.  
  However, **around 90% of the content is from 2023**, and some parts might seem unclear or messy.
- Several libraries were used (you'll see them in the code).
- Some sound effects and music are from existing sources:
  - An old version of **Honkai Impact 3rd**
  - **Lofi Girl**, **NCS**, and others.
- The icons were **created by me in 2023 using Blender**.
- **An executable file is also available** for anyone who wants to try the game on any computer without needing to install Python.

Thanks for your understanding,  
And have fun exploring the code!
